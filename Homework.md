# PHP Internship Homework Task 
 
Some generous people are organizing fundraisers for various charities. There is only one 
problem: they do not have a way of tracking donations. To help them, you are going 
to create a CLI application 
(https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.usage.php) that will let them 
log donations to specific charities. 
 
### The donation should have the following fields: 
- id  
- donor name  
- amount  
- charity id  
- date time 
### Charity should have the following fields:  
- id  
- name 
- representative email 
### The application should have the following functionality:  
- View charities  
- Add charity  
- Edit charity  
- Delete charity  
- Add donation 
### Requirements:  
- Do not use any frameworks or packages. 
- Do validation (valid email, donation, etc.) 
- Write code using the best OOP practices. 
- Push your code to a Git repository  (e.g.,  GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) and share 
the link with us.  
 
 
Good luck!
